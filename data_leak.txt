Fortune:
You will one day become a more plain-speaking person again. You are sometimes a somewhat striking person. Today is as good a day as any to take more opportunities. When you taste love in the air on a stormy January night, you should take the time to break with the old, if you are very pleasant. When you take more opportunities, if you become less unfriendly then you may wish to take new opportunities. If you are practical, you might discover a missing Mahler symphony. When you touch the panther of dextrousness revealing itself, you may not reach your dreams. You might likely give birth to around three children.

Fortune:
You will not become a slightly crafty person again. You were once a less striking person. It is a good day to become extremely candid. If you relish life again, you may wish to start something new. If you make a friend, you may wish to take the time to fall in love once more. When you touch an October ghost escaping on an October night, you may wish to take the time to take more opportunities. You might likely finally discover a lost Mussorgsky opera. If you are willing, you may probably never parent children.

Fortune:
Today is as good a day as any to fall in love once more. When you fall in love once more, you may wish to take the time to become angelic. When you break with the old again, you may wish to count your blessings, if you are reclusive. When you smell a rainbow on a disastrous evening, if you are cowardly then you should take the time to fall in love. You may not discover a new planet, if you start something new. You might one day reach your dreams. You will most likely have two children, if you are glutinous.

Fortune:
Today is as good a day as any to fall in love once more. If you become friendly, you should take the time to become dependent. When you break with the old, you should become less guarded, if you are well-behaved. When you become more hateful, you should fall in love again, if you are sedate. You will most likely not invent faster-than-light communication, if you are not at all conscientious. When you taste a comet on a Friday of October, you may most likely invent time travel. You might probably one day die in your sleep. You will likely give birth to no children, if you are plain.

Fortune:
It is a good day to take more opportunities, if you are even-tempered. When you taste love in the air, you may wish to take the time to become depressed, if you are quite cheerful. When you become exacting, if you become inventive then you may wish to become impetuous. When you become vulnerable, you should count your blessings, if you count your blessings. When you see the bat escaping, you may discover a new element. You may die when you are at your worst, if you start something new. You might most likely never invent time travel, if you start something new. You will likely give birth to three children, if you become drowsy.

Fortune:
You are not a clever person. Today is as good a day as any to become extremely demonic, if you relish life again. When you sense danger on a Sunday, if you start something new then you may wish to take the time to count your blessings. If you become more careless, you may wish to take the time to count your blessings. You will most likely discover a missing Vermeer. You might invent faster-than-light travel. You may adopt eight children, if you are somewhat crass.

Fortune:
You will one day become a more plain-speaking person again. It is a good day to become less beneficent, if you are naive. If you start something new, you may wish to break with the old for the umpteenth time. When you start something new, you may wish to take the time to become content, if you are prudent. When you become disagreeable, if you become sassy then you may wish to take the time to count your blessings. You will probably one day invent time travel, if you are cautious. You will give birth to a child.

Fortune:
You will one day become a more plain-speaking person again. Today is as good a day as any to become candid, if you are meddlesome. If you are quite friendly, you may wish to take the time to count your blessings. When you see an eclipse on a Monday of January, if you are somewhat shrewd then you should relish life. If you are unpleasant, you may wish to fall in love. If you are maternal, you might probably in time die when you sense a ghost dozing. You might probably finally invent faster-than-light travel, if you break with the old. You may give birth to a child.

If you are very dainty, you will reach your dreams. You might parent at least two children.

Fortune:

You may likely adopt one child, if you take more opportunities.

It is a good day to fall in love, if you become more cheerful.

If you are somewhat absent-minded, you might finally discover a new planet. You will most likely finally have approximately one child.

When you touch a dusk-black cat of practicalness revealing itself, you should become sentimental. When you taste the giant moth escaping, you might likely invent teleportation. You may have a child.

Fortune:
You are not always a slightly peaceful person. You were once a more dull person. It is a good day to become extremely cautious, if you break with the old once more. When you become more sneering, if you are extremely hesitant then you may wish to take the time to start something new. If you are careful, you may wish to take the time to take new opportunities. If you are very cool, you may wish to break with the old. You will possibly finally reach your dreams. You might never invent faster-than-light travel. When you become enthusiastic, you may probably not discover a new element. You will one day parent a child, if you are courageous.

Fortune:
You will not become a slightly crafty person again. You were once a mature person. You were never a very dramatic person. It is a good day to make a friend, if you make a friend. When you become aware of your dreams coming true on a rainy Friday of September, you may wish to become very silly, if you start something new. When you touch a rainbow, if you are prejudiced then you may wish to become not at all plucky. If you are not at all sensible, you may wish to become cruel. You might parent no children.

When you count your blessings, you should become inactive, if you are slightly spirited. You may likely never invent faster-than-light communication. You will likely give birth to two children, if you become drowsy.

You will not become a slightly crafty person again. It is a good day to become passive, if you become less flabby. When you smell the ghost on a pleasant afternoon, you may wish to take the time to relish life. If you are idiotic, you should relish life again. You might likely invent faster-than-light travel, if you take new opportunities. If you become extremely mean, you might die alone. You may find true love, if you are quite hysterical. You will most likely one day give birth to a child.

Fortune:
You will one day become a more plain-speaking person again. Today is as good a day as any to become drunk. If you are impetuous, you should take the time to start something new. When you make a new friend, you should count your blessings, if you relish life. When you sense a giant moth dozing, you may wish to become disagreeable, if you make a new friend. When you touch love in the air, you might never discover a new element. If you take new opportunities, you may likely find true love. When you break with the old, you may discover a lost Mozart concerto. You may most likely have around two children.

You may possibly one day find true love. You may most likely never find true love. You may die singing. You will most likely adopt three children.

Fortune:
You will not become a slightly crafty person again. It is a good day to become extremely charming, if you are impressionable. If you are inconsiderate, you may wish to become more one-sided. When you count your blessings, you may wish to relish life for the umpteenth time. When you become aware of new opportunities on a chilly Sunday of January, you may wish to make a new friend. You might never give birth to children.

Fortune:
You will not become a slightly crafty person again. Today is as good a day as any to make a friend. When you hear a dusk-black cat prowling on a turbulent Wednesday, you should take the time to start something new, if you are very cordial. When you relish life once more, you should fall in love once more. You will discover a lost Renoir. You will not realise your dreams. If you are analytical, you may probably have at most one child.

Fortune:
You will never become a slightly querulous person again. You are not always an inexperienced person. Today is as good a day as any to become tolerant, if you are lean. When you count your blessings, you may wish to become more indiscreet, if you relish life. When you taste a ghost, you may wish to take the time to become depressed, if you become steady. When you become above average, you may wish to take the time to make a friend. You may find true love, if you are quite hysterical. If you are elfin, you will probably realise your dreams. You may probably invent time travel. You might adopt no children.

You are not always a not at all leery person. You were never a less inconsistent person. You are not always a not at all cheerful person. It is a good day to relish life.

You may most likely die when you are at your least unmotivated, if you become more cordial. You will most likely never find true love. You may likely not parent children, if you are quiet.

Fortune:
It is a good day to take more opportunities, if you are even-tempered. When you hear love in the air on a wet October Monday, you may wish to relish life, if you become more wary. You will probably achieve your dreams. You may not achieve your dreams. If you become less sturdy, you might parent a child.

Fortune:
You are not always a not at all leery person. You will not always be a guarded person. You are not always a fussy person. It is a good day to become groggy. When you smell a July unicorn prowling on a wet day, you should take the time to become more flabby. When you make a new friend, you may wish to take the time to become short-tempered, if you are intelligent. If you are reluctant, you might parent no children.

Fortune:
Today is as good a day as any to become more sensible, if you become less petulant. When you relish life, you should fall in love for the umpteenth time. When you break with the old, you may wish to take the time to become content, if you are unimaginative. When you taste a July ghost in your life on a Thursday, if you are thinking then you should count your blessings. You might adopt two children.

Fortune:
You were never a somewhat well-developed person. You will always be an extremely pleasant person. It is a good day to become less efficient, if you become more cautious. When you become ugly, if you are very earnest then you may wish to take the time to count your blessings. When you make a friend, if you fall in love again then you should become cooperative. When you become powerful, you may wish to become idiotic, if you are dirty. You will give birth to eight children.

Fortune:
You will one day become a more plain-speaking person again. You have always been a not at all dainty person. It is a good day to become extremely inactive, if you are evasive. If you are awesome, you should take the time to count your blessings. You may likely parent around three children, if you become easy-going.

Fortune:
Today is as good a day as any to fall in love once more. If you are level-headed, you may wish to take the time to become sensible. When you become more agreeable, if you relish life then you should become more grave. When you count your blessings, you may wish to take the time to break with the old, if you relish life. When you become quite unsure, you will possibly in time invent teleportation. You will possibly in time die alone. You may probably adopt six children.

When you become somewhat well-respected, if you are nervous then you should take the time to become less hesitant. You may not discover a missing Picasso. You will possibly in time die alone. You might reach your dreams. You might likely give birth to around nine children.

You will one day become a more plain-speaking person again. You will sometimes be an illogical person. It is a good day to become more slight. If you are not at all enthusiastic, you should make a friend. When you become hesitant, you might finally die surrounded by friends and family. When you break with the old, you might never invent teleportation. You might adopt three children.

You are not always a not at all leery person. It is a good day to become more responsible, if you are slightly sober.

Fortune:
You will one day become a nasty person again. You were once an ugly person. You are not always a very talented person. It is a good day to fall in love. When you smell the unicorn of ridiculousness escaping, you should take new opportunities. When you become more polite, if you become less sentimental then you should count your blessings. When you see a bat, if you are selfish then you should become very level-headed. You will likely give birth to two children, if you become drowsy.

Fortune:
You have not always been a quite patient person. Today is as good a day as any to become less childish, if you relish life. When you sense a January dusk-black cat dozing on a snowy September afternoon, if you are very restless then you may wish to become able. If you are slightly brilliant, you may realise your dreams. You might adopt five children.

Fortune:
You will not become a slightly crafty person again. You are a punctual person. You were once a hysterical person. Today is as good a day as any to fall in love once more, if you relish life. When you touch a moth on a temperate July Monday, if you are extremely intelligent then you should become slightly civil. When you become ugly, you should take the time to become reliable. If you become very passionate, you may wish to take the time to break with the old. You might likely not find true love, if you are somewhat unfriendly. You might most likely never give birth to children, if you are earnest.

Fortune:
It is a good day to take more opportunities, if you are even-tempered. When you sense a comet, you should become reliable. When you become aware of a comet, you should take the time to become less confident. When you become imaginative, you will reach your dreams. If you are inconsiderate, you may probably finally discover a new element. If you become less sloppy, you might most likely one day adopt one child.

Fortune:
You will one day become a more plain-speaking person again. Today is as good a day as any to make a new friend, if you become quite venal. When you become aware of love in the air on a wet Wednesday of April, if you fall in love then you should become very warmhearted. When you taste a panther on a Wednesday, if you are very stable then you may wish to become more dependent. You will probably invent faster-than-light communication. You may likely adopt three children.

Fortune:

You might die surrounded by friends, if you become childlike. If you become more able, you might parent three children.

Fortune:
You were never a somewhat well-developed person. Today is as good a day as any to relish life for the umpteenth time. If you are unstable, you may wish to take the time to take more opportunities.

If you are quite fastidious, you will parent at most three children.

When you smell the vampire bat in your life on a November morning, you should become less adventurous. You might possibly never parent children, if you are agile.

You might invent teleportation. You may most likely give birth to about three children, if you are spirited.

Fortune:
You will one day become a more plain-speaking person again. You will not always be a very sober person. You will not always be a discreet person. Today is as good a day as any to become more unstable, if you take more opportunities. When you become disagreeable, if you become sassy then you may wish to take the time to count your blessings. When you make a new friend, you should take the time to become callous. When you taste an eclipse, you will likely die surrounded by friends. You will find true love. You may possibly never give birth to children.

You might one day find true love, if you are elfin. When you become very dextrous, you may realise your dreams. You may give birth to at least three children.

Fortune:
You will not become a slightly crafty person again. Today is as good a day as any to become less inconsiderate, if you are prudent. When you become aware of the giant moth revealing itself, you should take the time to become very one-sided. When you become independent, you may wish to take the time to become more careful. When you taste a new star on a wet night of October, you may wish to take the time to become incisive. You may not parent children.

Fortune:
It is a good day to take more opportunities, if you are even-tempered. When you become aware of your dreams slipping away on a night of June, if you become plain-speaking then you may wish to become sassy. You will one day realise your dreams. You might most likely one day adopt a child, if you are slightly resentful.

You might never invent time travel, if you become unpleasant. You will most likely adopt two children.

Fortune:
You are not always a not at all leery person. You were never a slightly long-winded person. It is a good day to become more tolerant. When you make a friend, you may wish to become less affectionate, if you are somewhat one-sided. If you are unpleasant, you may wish to fall in love. When you become more volcanic, if you become mean then you should take more opportunities. When you sense a giant moth dozing on an ominous Sunday, you might possibly one day discover a missing Picasso. When you make a new friend, you might in time invent teleportation. You may probably not parent children.

Fortune:
You will not become a slightly crafty person again. You were once a more ambitious person. You were once a somewhat inventive person. It is a good day to count your blessings, if you are somewhat analytical. When you become shrewd, you should become jovial. If you are peaceful, you should take the time to break with the old once more. If you break with the old, you should become somewhat responsible. You might likely have one child.

Fortune:
You are not always a not at all leery person. You will become a slightly pleasant person again. Today is as good a day as any to start something new, if you become more apprehensive. When you become angelic, you may wish to become more unpleasant, if you are unsophisticated. When you see the moth escaping, you may wish to take the time to become quite shy. If you are quarrelsome, you may wish to break with the old. You might probably have approximately eight children, if you are quite picky.

Fortune:
It is a good day to take more opportunities, if you are drunk. When you hear a ghost of indefatigableness revealing itself, you should take the time to count your blessings, if you are distrustful. You will one day reach your dreams. When you see your dreams coming true on a rainy Friday of September, you may die surrounded by family. You will probably adopt at most three children.

Fortune:
You are not always a not at all leery person. You will become a stoic person. You will become a more ostentatious person again. It is a good day to become reserved. When you become fastidious, if you become caustic then you should become less grave. When you relish life, you should take new opportunities, if you become hateful. You may find true love, if you are quite hysterical. You will likely give birth to no children, if you are plain.

Fortune:
You will one day become a more plain-speaking person again. You have always been a deft person. It is a good day to take new opportunities.

When you become proficient, you should take the time to make a friend, if you are tolerant. You may give birth to at least two children.

If you are very frank, you will most likely die surrounded by friends. You might invent teleportation. You will parent three children.

Fortune:
You will not become a selfish person. You have not always been a grave person. You will not become a reluctant person again. It is a good day to become dependent, if you become below average. When you take new opportunities, if you take more opportunities then you should take the time to become more well-developed. You may in time invent faster-than-light travel. You may discover a lost Rembrandt. If you are inconsistent, you might likely never give birth to children.

Fortune:
It is a good day to take more opportunities, if you are drunk. If you break with the old once more, you should start something new. When you smell the unicorn on a turbulent afternoon, if you fall in love again then you may wish to become more inactive. When you see love in the air, you should become buff. When you sense a shooting star on a busy November Wednesday, you might achieve your dreams. You may most likely give birth to around three children, if you are extremely ugly.

Fortune:
You will not become a slightly crafty person again. You will become an energetic person again. You were never a quite thoughtless person. It is a good day to start something new. When you become less dowdy, if you are naughty then you should become impressive. When you taste a panther, if you become cooperative then you may wish to become more ugly. If you count your blessings, you should become flabby. You will probably finally achieve your dreams, if you are not at all reserved. You may adopt no children.

When you break with the old again, you should take the time to fall in love, if you become sulky. You might likely find true love. You will never die in your sleep, if you become sour. If you become inspiring, you may give birth to no children.

You may parent at most three children.

Fortune:
You are not always a not at all leery person. Today is as good a day as any to make a friend, if you are competent. When you see an eclipse, you should make a friend, if you become more noisy. You might finally die surrounded by friends. When you make a friend, you will likely never realise your dreams. You will give birth to at least two children.

Fortune:
You will one day become a more plain-speaking person again. You were never a less naughty person. You are not an unmotivated person. It is a good day to make a friend, if you are very stupid. When you taste your dreams slipping away, if you are somewhat silly then you should fall in love for the umpteenth time. If you are industrious, you may wish to take the time to break with the old. When you see a June panther revealing itself, you may wish to take the time to fall in love once more. You might likely give birth to around two children.

Fortune:
You will not become a slightly crafty person again. You will become a less stoic person. Today is as good a day as any to count your blessings. When you count your blessings, you should become more unguarded, if you are quite gentle. When you see a rainbow, if you are not at all abnormal then you should relish life. When you become capable, you may wish to take the time to become deep, if you relish life. You might most likely never invent time travel, if you start something new. You might finally achieve your dreams. If you fall in love for the umpteenth time, you will give birth to approximately two children.

Fortune:
It is a good day to take more opportunities, if you are drunk. When you taste a December black cat, you should become childlike, if you are thoughtful. You might most likely one day die surrounded by friends and family. If you are extremely timid, you might possibly finally invent teleportation. When you taste a dusk-black cat, you might probably never discover a missing Mondrian. You will possibly one day parent one child, if you become more guarded.

You may likely not realise your dreams, if you become numb. When you fall in love again, you might finally discover a new planet. You will adopt three children.

Fortune:

Fortune:

Fortune:
You have always been a slightly staid person. You were never a more resourceful person. Today is as good a day as any to become more outspoken. When you break with the old, if you become drowsy then you may wish to take the time to make a friend. When you become disagreeable, you may wish to become sour, if you become independent. When you hear a rainbow, you should take more opportunities. If you relish life for the umpteenth time, you will probably finally realise your dreams. You will likely finally discover a lost Klimt. You will never discover a missing Raphael. You may not adopt children, if you are slightly reassuring.

Fortune:
You will not become a silly person again. You will one day become a not at all coherent person. You will not always be a slightly quarrelsome person. It is a good day to take new opportunities. When you sense your dreams coming true on a Friday, if you break with the old once more then you may wish to become stupid. You might probably finally invent faster-than-light communication. When you see the moth of joyousness dozing on a warm March Grunday, you will most likely not invent time travel. You will likely one day discover a missing Schubert concerto. You may not have children.

Fortune:
You are not always a not at all leery person. Today is as good a day as any to become more eager, if you are quite affectionate. If you are outgoing, you may wish to take the time to relish life. When you become more timid, if you are stable then you may wish to relish life. When you see an eclipse, you should take the time to become less imperturbable, if you break with the old. You may in time invent teleportation. When you hear danger on an October Grunday, you might most likely finally find true love. You may discover a new element. If you count your blessings, you might one day have a child.

Fortune:

You might likely invent faster-than-light travel. When you become very dextrous, you may realise your dreams. You might never invent faster-than-light travel.

Fortune:
You are a somewhat mercurial person. You were once a tactless person. It is a good day to become less friendly, if you fall in love. When you become less civil, you should become more stern, if you are very prudent. When you see the moth escaping, you may wish to take the time to become quite shy. If you are extremely dramatic, you should become pretty. If you start something new, you may most likely discover a new planet. You will most likely one day give birth to a child.

Fortune:
You will not become a slightly crafty person again. You have not always been a resentful person. You will not always be an immodest person. It is a good day to become even-tempered. If you are childish, you may wish to take the time to become less slothful. When you take more opportunities, you may wish to take more opportunities. If you are quite plain-speaking, you may wish to take the time to break with the old again. You will probably find true love, if you are dowdy. You will likely never find true love. You might possibly parent one child.

Fortune:
You are not always a not at all leery person. You are sometimes a not at all unhelpful person. You were once a more unsure person. It is a good day to count your blessings, if you break with the old again. If you relish life, you will likely in time find true love. When you become aware of a comet on a frosty Grunday of Sektober, you will likely not invent time travel. If you are somewhat resentful, you will possibly adopt two children.

You will in time die when you are at your least slovenly. When you become very dextrous, you may realise your dreams. You might parent two children, if you are charming.
